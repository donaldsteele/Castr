## LLM Wiki

This project maintains an LLM-curated wiki at `wiki/` following Andrej Karpathy's "LLM Wiki" pattern (https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Before answering questions that rely on knowledge accumulated in this project, read `wiki/index.md` (or the relevant shard under `wiki/indexes/` if the wiki has been sharded) and use its one-line summaries to find the pages you need. Cite with `[[wikilinks]]`. If the index does not surface good candidates, fall back to `wiki_search.py` from the `llm-wiki` skill for local hybrid retrieval; add `--no-embed` for dependency-free BM25.

To add a new source, follow the `llm-wiki` skill's ingest workflow: decide placement under `wiki/sources/`, `wiki/entities/`, `wiki/concepts/`, or `wiki/synthesis/`; identify touched pages and make surgical `str_replace` updates rather than rewrites; update the index; append a one-line entry to `wiki/log.md`.

Scaling discipline: atomic pages (400-line soft cap, 800-line hard cap), sharded indexes past ~150 pages or 300 index lines, required YAML frontmatter on every page, `[[wikilinks]]` for every cross-reference.

Full conventions live in `wiki/SCHEMA.md`. Treat it as authoritative when it disagrees with this summary.

## Codebase graph (graphify)

This project also maintains a `graphify` knowledge graph of the codebase itself under `graphify-out/` (run `/graphify --update` after non-trivial code changes). When resuming work or answering "how does X work" / "where is Y" questions about the code, prefer `graphify query "<question>"` over re-reading the whole tree — it's cheaper and the graph already exists once M1 is underway.

## Project state

Milestone status and the durable cross-session task list live in `wiki/synthesis/roadmap.md`, not in any ephemeral todo list. Read it first when resuming this project after a restart.
